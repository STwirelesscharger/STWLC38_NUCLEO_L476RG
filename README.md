# Introduction

This use NUCLEO_L476RG board and I2C to download STWLC38
Use STM32 CubeMx to generate code, STM32 CubeMx file is STWLC38_NUCLEO_L476RG.ioc

## Notice

1.Mini Heap size need to set large for example 0x800
2.I2C interrupt need to enable and I2C GPIO pin need set to pull up
3.Doc folder have hex file and logs
